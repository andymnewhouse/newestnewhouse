        text: 'Jess and Andy met up with Scott, the photographer, found a bench to sit down at and revealed Andy''s early birthday present - a book of memories and photos compiled by Jess.  This book also served as a cue for Scott to know that Jess was about to propose. After Andy looked through the photos, Jess got down on one knee with a master-ball in hand. She had spent a lot of time thinking about how to propose and what to say but in the moment her thoughts swirled together and she just started with "hi." Andy said hi back and leaned down to give Jess a kiss. Jess finally said what she had been planning to say "I don''t have to catch ''em all, as long as I can catch you. We fit together perfectly and I don''t want to Lego of you. And I can''t think of a better companion to travel with me through time and space. Andy, I have loved you for longer than I have known and I will love you for longer than I can imagine." Jess removed her Lego mini-figure holding the ring and held it up for Andy to see and she asked "Will you marry me?" '
